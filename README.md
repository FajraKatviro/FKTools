# ImagesetManager
Toolset for mobile image sizepacks management
Store content files in source folders and create binary packages in resource build folder

Tool used with following file structure

1. Source folders

ProjectFolder
	./AnyProjectSubfolders...
	./ResourcesFolder
		./AnyResourcesSubfolders...
		./PackableImageResourses
			./PackageName1
				./package.json
				./800x600
					./Image1.png
					./Image2.png
					./OtherProvidedImagesForThisResolution...
				./1024x2048
					./Image2.png
					./OtherProvidedImagesForThisResolution...
				./OtherProvidedTargetResolutions...
			./PackageName2
				./package.json
				./320x640
					./Image3.png
					./OtherProvidedImagesForThisResolution...
				./1024x2048
					./Image2.png
					./OtherProvidedImagesForThisResolution...
				./OtherProvidedTargetResolutions...
			./OtherPackages...

There are package source folders in project folder tree. You can process all of them within specific folder (i.e. PackableImageResourses) in 1 generator call (see -f option)

There is package.json in each package source folder. File generated by package manager and manually modified with image manager. This json contains package settings used by generator

There are sizeset folders in each package. At least 1 sizeset is required. Folders should have name consist of width and height joined with 'x' letter. Sizeset means not image sizes, but 'native' screen size images designed for (bg, icons, buttons, etc.)

There are image files in each sizeset folder. Thease images provided by artists and used as source data for generator. 


2. Build folders

ResourcesBuildFolder
	./AnySubfolders...
	./PackableImageResourses
		./PackageName1
			./320x640.rcc
			./320x640
				./package.qrc
				./Image1.png
				./Image2.png
				./OtherRequiredImages...
			./800x600.rcc
			./800x600
				./package.qrc
				./Image1.png
				./Image2.png
				./OtherRequiredImages...
			./1024x2048.rcc
			./1024x2048
				./package.qrc
				./Image1.png
				./Image2.png
				./OtherRequiredImages...
			./OtherRequiredResolutions...
		./PackageName2
			./320x640.rcc
			./320x640
				./package.qrc
				./Image2.png
				./Image3.png
				./OtherRequiredImages...
			./800x600.rcc
			./800x600
				./package.qrc
				./Image2.png
				./Image3.png
				./OtherRequiredImages...
			./1024x2048.rcc
			./1024x2048
				./package.qrc
				./Image2.png
				./Image3.png
				./OtherRequiredImages...
			./OtherRequiredResolutions...
		./OtherPackages...

There are packages driven by generator.

There are all required (listed in package.json) sizesets in package.

There are all package images (listed in package.json) in each sizeset. If no image with required sizeset provided, generator scales image from other sizeset (provided by package.json or use 'best' sizeset). If size of final image exceeds sizeset dimensions, image can be cropped (if required by package.json)

There is package.qrc file for each sizeset. File created by generator and used by Qt resource compiler to build binary packages

There are sizeset.rcc files (binary package) for each sizeset. Files are created when generator calls Qt resource compiler
